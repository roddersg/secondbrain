		- minimalist installation of cond which is an environment and package manager
			- combines venv (environment ), pip (package manager)
			- much smaller weight than anaconda
		- check zsh file for installation and PATh at the end of the .zshrc file
		- use the add channels to add [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org) for more packages
		- requirements.txt
			- create environment with the requirements.txt file
			  ```bash
			  conda create --name <ENV_NAME> --file requirements.txt
			  ```
			- read in the requirements.txt file
			  ```bash
			  conda install --file requirements.txt
			  ```
			- create the requirements.txt file
			  ```bash
			  conda list -e > requirements.txt
			  ```
			- the requirements.txt file is **NOT** compatibleiwth `pip`
			  to make it [`pip` compatible](https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/conda-create-and-install-requirements-txt), you need to
			  ```bash
			  # activate the environment
			  conda activate <ENV>
			  # install pip if not already installed
			  conda install pip 
			  # generate the requirements.txt
			  pip freeze > requirements.txt
			  # sometimes, to get rid of funny paths
			  pip list --format=freeze > requirements.txt
			  ```
