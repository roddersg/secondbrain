## Programming #programming
	- ### [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) #kitty #terminal
	  a modern configurable terminal emulator
		- using curl, kitty installs into `~/.local/kitty.app/`.  The executable is in the bin folder.  On installation it opens up a terminal window (see lauch bar for the kitty logo) - very vanilla
		  ```bash
		  curl -L https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/installer.sh | sh /dev/stdin
		  ```
	- ### configuration
		- configuration files are kept in  `~/.config/kitty`
		- to change the theme (kitty has lots of them), use
		  ```bash
		  kitty +kitten themes
		  ```
		  search and select the **nightowl** theme and set it
		- **fonts**
			- to list the types of fonts you can use: 
			  `kitty +list-fonts --psnames | grep JetBrains`
			- to change the fonts:
			  ```bash
			  cd ~/.config/kitty
			  echo "include ./font.conf" > kitty.conf
			  echo "font_family JetBrains Mono" > font.conf
			  ```
				- other font configurations are found at [kitty fonts](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/conf/#fonts). 
				  Close and reopen kitty, try the ligature chars (!=. ->)!
		- Separated each of the configurations into files **.conf** for easier eding
		  Look at the ~/.config/kitty folder
	- ### Sample configurations
		- print out a default config, see sample.conf which prints out a commented version
		- pressing C+S F2 will print out a sample.conf with comments.
		- See the Ubuntu man pages fof detailed listing on the configuration file
		- print out kitty.conf https://github.com/ershov/kitty_config this is mapped to the kitty_mod+, (crtl-Shift+, [comma]) which prints out the full configuration file.
		  here is the zipped asset: [kitty_config-main.zip](../assets/kitty_config-main_1699109217599_0.zip)
		- print out keyboard layouts https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/2164 look at the code for `keymap.py` at the bottom of the discussion.
		  A copy is kept here: [keymap.py](../assets/keymap_1699108824064_0.py)
		  you need to put in a key mapping `map kitty_mod+/ kitten keymap.py` into kitty.conf

	- ## Changing the default terminal for Ubuntu 22.04 #terminal #ubuntu
		- To change the default x-terminal-emulator, such that Ctrl-Alt-T brings up the terminal you have to
			- install the location of the terminal emulator
				- ```bash
				  sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/x-terminal-emulator x-terminal-emulator /path-to/kitty 1
				  ```
			- select the default terminal emulator
				- ```bash
				  sudo update-alternatives --config x-terminal-emulator
				  ```
				- from the list select your default terminal.  You can now test it with Ctrl-Alt-T
			- remove if you don't want it any more
				- ```bash
				  sudo update-alternatives --remove x-terminal-emulator /path-to/kitty
				  ```
