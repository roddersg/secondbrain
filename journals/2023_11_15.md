## ZSH #zsh
	- Manual configuration of zsh without plugin manager.  Taken from [Customise Your ZSH by The Rad Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgdR27KMxpo).  This is a good start to zsh as it shows what is to be done and which files are required.
	- Prep
		- Removing the following to clean up system
			- .local/share/zap a plugin manager
			- .zshenv, .zshrc, .env.zsh, ~/.cache/zsh4humans
	- Initial work
		- work with zsh
		  ```
		  $ echo $SHELL
		  /usr/bin/bash					# usually default shell
		  $ chsh -s $(which zsh)
		  
		  # need to login/logoff to se the shell
		  ```
	- Starting zsh
		- you will be prompted to answer a number of questions
			- 1 - continue to main menu
			- Change the HISTSIZE=51000 (slightly bigger) and SAVEHIST=50000
			- Choose defaults for AutoCompletion
			- Save and restart. (the rest of the options will be done manually)
			- Note:
			  ```
			  The function will not be run in future, but you can run
			  it yourself as follows:
			    autoload -Uz zsh-newuser-install
			    zsh-newuser-install -f
			  ```
		- Basic installation: .zshrc
		  ```zsh
		  # Lines configured by zsh-newuser-install
		  HISTFILE=~/.histfile
		  HISTSIZE=51000
		  SAVEHIST=50000
		  # End of lines configured by zsh-newuser-install
		  # The following lines were added by compinstall
		  zstyle :compinstall filename '/home/rodney/.zshrc'
		  
		  autoload -Uz compinit
		  compinit
		  # End of lines added by compinstall
		  ```
		- configuration should be done in `~/.config/zsh` in line with other software.
			- This is a precise write-up of how the z-files are executed [StackExchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/71253/what-should-shouldnt-go-in-zshenv-zshrc-zlogin-zprofile-zlogout/71258#71258)
			- Examples of [dotfiles on github](https://github.com/search?q=zsh+dotfiles&ref=commandbar&type=repositories)
			- global configuration is done in /etc/zsh/zenv  (the .zenv file is always read first, but in this case it is globally executed)
			- ```zsh
			  # This is the local .zenv file, which is always read and is the first file
			  #
			  # Borrow $PATH from the /etc/zsh/zshenv file
			  if [[ -z "$PATH" || "$PATH" == "/bin:/usr/bin" ]]
			  then
			      export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin/:~/bin"
			  fi
			  
			  # Tell everyone the location of the config files
			  if [[ -z "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME" ]]
			  then
			      export XDG_CONFIG_HOME="$HOME/.config"
			  fi
			  
			  # Tell everyone where the zsh files are
			  if [[ -d "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/zsh" ]]
			  then
			      export ZDOTDIR="$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/zsh"
			  fi
			  ```
	- Configuring plugins
		- Directory structure:
		  ```zsh
		  .config
		   └── zsh					# .zshrc and other .zsh files
		       └── plugins            # plugins
		  ```
		- [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) a cursor theming plugin
			- follow manual instructions from site, clone into $ZDOTDIR/plugins
			- check that source p10k changes $ZDOTDIR/.zshrc
			- if you need to reconfigure run`p10k configure`
		- aliasrc
			- keep all the aliases in this file within the $ZDOTDIR
		- optionsrc
			- keep all the zsh options here
		- [autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)  Fish-like auto-suggestions when you key in commands.  It suggests commands as you type based on history and completions.
			- use manual method to clone the plugin into the plugin folder
		- [fast-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/fast-syntax-highlighting)
			- Feature rich syntax highlighting for Zsh, shows unknown or incorrect commands in red.
		- [zsh history sub-string search](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search)
			- a FISH-like feature which allows you to search history for a substring
			- need to fix the Up and Dn arrows, there are 3 sets of bindings, test and choose the correct on.
			- type in a command e.g. git then use the Up and Dn arrows to go through the history looking for the substring.  When the top/bottom is reached the sub-string changes color
			- it pays to have a large history file so that previous settings can be found
		- [vim-mode line editing](https://github.com/jeffreytse/zsh-vi-mode)
			- vi mode editing for the command line
			- use ESC and then Vim-motions to move/change the shell command
