- ## ZSH #zsh
	- Awesome ZSH Plugins galore (start here) https://github.com/unixorn/awesome-zsh-plugins
	- [ZSH Fro Humans](https://github.com/romkatv/zsh4humans) seems to use the same manual configurations that I have for my own .zsh
	- My Old configuration
		- $HOME [.zshenv](../assets/.zshenv_1699184280203_0)
			- $HOME/config/zsh
				- .zshrc configuration  [.zshrc](../assets/.zshrc_1699184497887_0)
				- Zipped contents (in folders)
	- ZSH4Humans installation
	  I have decided to try this installation with the following modifications:
		- .zshrc has a section in the middle for you to enter your own configuration
		  ```bash
		  # Source additional local files if they exist.
		  # .env.zsh   is the file where you place your aliases etc
		  z4h source ~/.env.zsh
		  
		  ```
		- this is my current [.env.zsh](../assets/.env_1699201711960_0.zsh)
		  added the conda statements there as well.
